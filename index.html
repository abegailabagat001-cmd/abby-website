      <h2>About Gender Equality</h2>
      <p>
        Gender equality means that all genders have equal access to opportunities, resources, and rights. 
        It is about ensuring fairness and removing discrimination so everyone can participate equally 
        in education, employment, and decision-making. Gender equality benefits not just women or men, 
        but the entire society.

      <h2>Why Gender Equality Is Important</h2>
      <p>
        Gender equality matters because it helps create a balanced and fair society. 
        When everyone is treated equally, people can contribute their talents and ideas 
        freely without fear or bias. It leads to better education, stronger economies, 
        and more peaceful communities.
